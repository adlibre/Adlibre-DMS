# Adlibre DMS

Adlibre DMS is a web based media and Document Management System (DMS / EDMS). 
It liberates you from hard-copy paper systems by creating a digital vault for your documents
that can be accessed from anywhere. The core philosophy is that your documents are secure, 
yet accessible from wherever they are required. 
With Adlibre DMS you can make your documents universally available within your business and across all your applications and systems.

It is the perfect system for archiving and transaction oriented document workflows.

And because it has a flexible architecture it is ideal for government and enterprise users,

Adlibre DMS is also 100% commercially supported Open Source.
